== JAX-RS (RESTEasy) Servlet Endpoint that provides ability to add / retrieve data

Example input as JSON
[source,json]

{
 "id":"foo",
 "timestamp":1234,
 "value":12.3
}
----

Example input as XML
[source,xml]
----
<idDataPoint>
  <id>foo</id>
  <timestamp>1234</timestamp>
  <value>12.3</value>
</idDataPoint>

=== Add data

Endpoint is http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics/{id} for a single data item

  $ curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics/foo -d@/tmp/fooX -HContent-Type:application/json

or if the input contains a collection of metrics (now you need to provide ids for each element in the array)

  $ curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics -d@/tmp/fooX -HContent-Type:application/json

=== Retrieve data

Endpoint is http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics/{id}

  $ curl -i http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics/foo?start=0\&end=2000 -HAccept:application/json

or simply

  $ curl -i http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics/foo

to receive data for the last 8 hours

Parameters are:

* start: defaults to now-8h
* end: defaults to now
* buckets: number of intervals (buckets) to divide the time range. buckets=60 will return 60 equally spaced intervals for the time period between start and end time, having min, avg, and max calculated for each interval.

=== List metric names

  $  curl -i http://localhost:8080/rhq-metrics/metrics

=== Running

==== Method 1 (easy)
`mvm clean install`

`mvn wildfly:run`

run `mvn install` to create the servlet and then drop it into a WildFly 8
instance into `standalone/deployments/` and start the server with `bin/standalone.sh`
