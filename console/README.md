# RHQ-Metrics UI Console

## Quickstart
Show me what the UI Console does: [RHQ-Metrics UI Quickstart Video](https://vimeo.com/101576357)   _Length - 8:33_


## Why?
I want to start using the rhq-metrics project in my own work. How do I start?
The console is a quick and easy way to populate and view the rhq-metrics datastore (either in-Memory or Cassandra).

## What does it do?
The console provides a simple UI for:
1. Inserting/creating  data in various ways
![Inserts](rhq-metrics-console.png "Inserts")

2. Viewing the data in the database both visually via a graph and a grid table
![Charts](rhqm-chart.png "Charts")

3. An example of the capabilities of rhq-metrics and the Angular.js charting components.

## Purpose
This console showcases the capabilities of rhq-metrics and the complementary UI components used to visualize the metric data in meaningful ways.

The console is very functional at populating a datastore and viewing its results graphically as well as a learning tool for working with the *rhq-metrics* suite.

The visual UI [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) components provided by the rhq-metrics project are the primary deliverable of the console/UI module and are intended to be plug-n-play components for quickly creating dashboards for the rhq-metrics backend.

The Angular.js components will be published as [bower](http://bower.io) packaged components(think maven repo) and published to the bower repository to be easily installed and consumed in other javascript applications.


## Install
The standard **mvn install** will build the war artifact in 'console/target/metrics-console-*.war'. Place this along with the 'rest-servlet/target/rest-servlet-*.war' in your app server deployments directory to have a functioning frontend/backend.
Browse [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) and explore...

## Dev Install (optional)
This is an optional development install for a standard [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) project.
Grunt is a build tool for javscript webapps just like maven is for java. The build capabilities of grunt are not used here as we are using maven for building/deploying. Grunt is used here for starting a development environment that automatically refreshes itself whenever html, css or javascript files change. Making a fast/agile environment for web development.

0. Go to proper directory **'cd console/src/main/webapp'**
1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)  (and npm) if not already installed
2. Install the node packages: **'npm install -g grunt-cli bower karma'**
(if you get an EACESS permission errors you may need to use sudo to the do the install)
3. Install npm packages for tooling: **'npm install'**
4. Optional: Install [Bower](http://bower.io) packages for UI: **'bower install'**
5. Start the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) Server: **'grunt serve'**
6. Browse [http://127.0.0.1:9000/](http://127.0.0.1:9000/) and explore...

Grunt will automatically launch a url for you in your browser and will reload any changes in real time to the browser. Feel Free to play around.

Tip: Make sure that you have a rest backend running so that the UI console can connect to something. 

1. **'cd rest-servlet'**
2. **'mvn wildfly:run'**

1. Check out the RHQ charts documentation which is what the charting component is originally based on: [RHQ Charts](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/d3+Charts)
2. The charting functionality is based on the [d3](http://d3js.org) javascipt library. Examples shown [here](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)
