= Hawkular Metrics Load Tests
:type: article

A simple load testing tool for Hawkular Metrics

== Why a Maven project?

Because it makes it easier for developers to fire a load test:
there's no need to download, extract and configure PATH.

== The scenario

The simulation consists in sending metrics reports from a configurable number of clients (like a collector sending
reports periodically). On top of the number of clients, many aspects of the simulation are configurable:
number of loops, interval, number of metrics per report, ... etc.

See the scenario file for the list of options.

== Running

 mvn gatling:execute -Dxxx=y ...

Each scenario option can be set with a system property.

The scenario assumes a Metrics server is running somewhere and does not start one.
By default, it tries to connect to `http://localhost:8080`.
